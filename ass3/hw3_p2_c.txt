PROBLEM 3.2:
B) we consider our loop invariant as being
 at each iteration the array (vector) A[0...key-1] is always sorted.

 We can consider this a loop invariant because
 - before the loop : k is not initialized so we assume its true
 - at each iteration of the loop :
  the subarray (subvector) A[0..key-1] is always sorted
 - at the end of the loop :
  key = size-1, So the subarray A[0..size-1] consist of (size-1+1)=size sorted elements
  and this is the initial size of our array

  with this we have proven correctness of  our selection sort algorithm
